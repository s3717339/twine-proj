A Twine Project 



By Max Clarke

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="begin" tags="" position="244,2169" size="100,100">You wake with a headache. Opening your eyes, all that can be seen is a small hole, far above you and out of reach. The tall trees seem to leer down at you from the surface. What is known?
You were walking in the forest, not sure where, not sure why. You had somewhere to go, that much is certain. The ground must have given way under your weight. Now you’ve found yourself in some sort of tunnel.
You wipe your eyes and find dried blood on your hand. A cut runs across your temple. That explains the headache. Not much to be done about that now. 
Beside you a [[backpack]] sits, half open and sprinkled with dirt.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="backpack" tags="" position="397,2167" size="100,100">Whatever you were here to do, it seems you’ve prepared inadequately. A half-full bottle of water, cigarette lighter, and a small camping knife. Its not much, but perhaps it won’t matter. Maybe there is a way back up to the surface close by. Just a matter of figuring out where to go. You’re in a larger area where the tunnel opens up – perhaps that’s why the ground caved in beneath you. From where you sit, you can see there are two ways forward. Both look the same, the only difference being that one is to your [[left]], the other to your [[right]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="left" tags="" position="559.6666666666666,2246.666666666667" size="100,100">You rise slowly and trudge over to the path that lies to your left. Arriving at the entrance to this path, there are two strange things that you notice. One is heard, the other seen.

Look.

Listen.

Perhaps the path to the [[right-&gt;RIGHT2]] is different.
(click-replace: "Listen.")[You stop and listen for a moment. There is an odd, growling noise, one that murmurs its way down the tunnel and into your ear. It sounds like some animal snarling, perhaps eating, but not one that you recognize. ] 
(click-replace: "Look.")[There is a puddle of viscous, glowing liquid that pools at your feet and trickles down into the depths of the tunnel. It is visually similar to a glow worm, except much brighter and more concentrated. You contemplate touching it, but something in you decides it won’t do any good.]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="right" tags="" position="555,2079" size="100,100">The path to the right seems promising, aside from the fact that it leads downward, away from the surface. It has an unsettling stillness about it, but there is nothing to indicate that there is any real danger waiting for you down this path. 
Perhaps the path to the [[left-&gt;LEFT2]] is different. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="LEFT2" tags="" position="684,2077" size="100,100">You rise slowly and trudge over to the path that lies to your left. Arriving at the entrance to this path, there are two strange things that you notice. One is heard, the other seen.

[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;decide]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="decide" tags="" position="836,2069" size="100,100">After examining both, it seems you must choose a path. There is no use sitting around waiting for something to happen. The only question is which way – [[Left-&gt;decide left]] or [[Right-&gt;decide right]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="decide left" tags="" position="834,2205" size="100,100">You take the path to your left. The slimy liquid at the entrance sticks to the soles of your boot as you tread over it. You bend downward to fit into the hole and travel forward. 
With each step, the growling noise becomes louder. With each step, it almost appears as if whatever it is making the sound seems more vicious, more aggravated. 
The path begins to dip downward abruptly, and the substance that trickles down with you begins to harden. As you progress it takes up more of the tunnel until there is no dirt left, just this rigid, unmalleable substance that has stiffened like plaster.
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;left cont]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="decide right" tags="" position="954,1806" size="100,100">You take the path to your right. After advancing just a few metres forward it becomes increasingly difficult to see. You pry open your bag and retrieve the lighter. It only grants you a small degree of vision, but it works. 
You crouch along for some time and gradually the tunnel opens up, allowing you to eventually move upright. The only problem is the tunnel is still going down. 
Continuing down the tunnel, it soon leads into a larger area. You move along the perimeter, but the only visible path is tiny – only just large enough to crawl through. There is no other option but to [[crawl forward]]. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="crawl forward" tags="" position="1074,1806.3333333333333" size="100,100">You shuffle forward down the hole, but after advancing a few metres the lighter begins to run out. It briefly lights a few times before completely failing. In trying to get it to work again, the flickering of the lighter illuminates something ahead. Past the sparks of the lighter you can see metal, illuminated by the last few sparks from the lighter. 
Upon further inspection, the metal seems to be thin, bending as you place pressure on it. The only thing to do it try and [[break through]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="break through" tags="" position="1190,1806" size="100,100">It takes time, but you manage to shuffle around into a feet-first position in the cramped crawlspace. You kick at the metal sheet for some time, and feel it shifting. 
You kick for a couple of minutes, but just as you are about to turn back the crawlspace caves in on itself and you are almost swallowed up by the wave of soil. 
The only way is forward. You kick with greater urgency and just as your efforts begin to feel futile, the metal gives way, and you are faced with some sort of air vent. 
You shuffle towards it and move into the [[vent-&gt;vent]]. 
 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="vent" tags="" position="1309,1806" size="100,100">You find yourself in a labyrinthian ventilation system. You shuffle your way forward, forced to guess which path is best. The whole way through, there is a thick dust that you bring into the air as you move, causing you to cough and sneeze constantly. What was left in your water bottle helps, but that is soon entirely depleted. Wherever you are, it is undeniably old, and has been in disuse for some time. After what must have been hours, you find a break in the vent, and [[kick it open]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="kick it open" tags="" position="1429,1805" size="100,100">You poke your head out and survey the area. The vent has lead into a massive concrete tunnel, silent and partly in ruin. There is rubble to your left, evidently where the tunnel has given way and the surrounding soil has prevailed. It dawns on you that it is quite miraculous that you have made it this far without injury. 
There is a substantial drop from the vent onto the ground of the tunnel, which almost buckles your legs and leaves your feet numb for a moment. You land and survey your surroundings further. There is minimal light – a small bulb that illuminates the tunnel every twenty metres or so, but the rest is obscured in almost complete darkness. A short distance to your left, there is a large sign that says “SECTOR C SECURITY” with an arrow pointing deeper into the tunnel. To your right, the tunnel seems to end abruptly. There is not much choice in the matter – the only way is [[left-&gt;tunnel left]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="tunnel left" tags="" position="1550,1806" size="100,100">You advance through the tunnel, with only a nondescript electrical hum to be heard, along with your footsteps clicking along the concrete. It is not long before you encounter the Security office for Sector C. The primitive sliding glass doors are half open, and you sidestep through and into the [[room-&gt;security sector C]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="security sector C" tags="" position="1669,1806" size="100,100">The entire office is in disarray. Paper lies scattered over the linoleum, and the beige desktop computer is smashed and left on its side. It looks as though a man-sized tornado made its way through the room. Immediately as you enter, one particular item catches your eye. A piece of lined paper sits on the edge of the desk, with a rubix cube left on it, presumably as a paperweight of sorts. You pick up the [[note-&gt;note1]] and examine it.   </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="note1" tags="note" position="1780,1806" size="100,100">I've decided to chronicle my experience from this point forward, in the hopes that someone may find these pages and understand my situation. 
I was in the sublevel examining some odd noises that had been reported for some time. As it turns out, some sort of animal burrowed down and was running rampant down there. In the few hours I spent investigating the issue, it seems something very sinister has occurred.
Up here on the main level, all the security and communications systems have been disabled. There is no sign of anyone here - the reason for this I have not yet ascertained. 
I feel obliged to make my way over to the central lab to find some answers, but there is a heavy thumping and scraping coming from the hallway outside the Security office.  
It is not a sound I’ve heard before in my time here, so naturally I assume the worst. My supplies here are also limited – I have less than a day’s worth of food here, that I found in the guard’s office. I hope whatever is making these noises stops soon. 

[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;note reflection]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="note reflection" tags="" position="1900,1803" size="100,100">The note leaves you with a tingling sensation, that moves in waves up and down your body. So many questions. It appears this facility is in a similar state to when this man found it, but what became of the thing that caused the noises he encountered? It seems that all the answers you need lie anywhere but here. You must [[press on]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="press on" tags="" position="2019,1802" size="100,100">You exit the security office and continue down the tunnel, as it begins to curve slightly to the right. After some time, you notice something sitting beside the wall, sitting under the light that is the third furthest from you. The sight causes you stop immediately. 
It is a person, propped up against the wall with their head tilted down toward their chest. One would assume he was asleep, if not for the darkened, dried blood that stains the floor around him. You must fight the nausea and [[approach-&gt;approach man]], as the man lies directly in your path. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="approach man" tags="" position="2137,1800" size="100,100">A numbness washes over you as you get close enough to properly see the man. There are lacerations all across his body, where maroon wounds hide partially behind his tattered uniform. Despite his horrific state, it is clear that his uniform is one of a security officer. 
More concerning still, is the pile of glowing liquid that lies to his right, previously obscured from view. It is the same as the kind you observed in the tunnel earlier.
Looking at the man for mere minutes is already too long, and you turn and [[move forward]] to save yourself from being ill. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="move forward" tags="" position="2250,1798" size="100,100">Your mind is heavy with concern, about what was responsible for that man’s untimely end, and whether you face the same fate. The tunnel seems to become smaller with each step, as you realise how limited your options are. 
Suddenly, you hear a thumping noise, steadily approaching from the tunnel ahead. It seems concerningly non-human and grows louder with each step. You know you must hide, but the question is [[where-&gt;decide no.2]]. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="decide no.2" tags="" position="2365,1796" size="100,100">Beside you there is [[darkness]], caused by a break in the lights. There is also some [[debris]] a fair distance ahead to hide behind, but whatever is approaching may make it there before you can. 
All you know is you must act quickly. 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="darkness" tags="" position="2366,1916.6666666666667" size="100,100">You quickly step to the side and crouch down, making yourself as small as you can. The darkness makes you near impossible to see. You have only a few seconds to prey that it will work before the thumping is only a few metres from your spot. You face the wall, too frightened to sneak a mere glimpse at what is coming. 
Whatever is here drifts past you, and there is a split second of relief as it seems you’ve gone unnoticed. Abruptly thereafter, the unknown being finds itself caught on your backpack, and it leaps at you.

[[Blood gushes from your neck as you fade away, with no chance of any answers for what just occurred.-&gt;if only decision 2(5)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="debris" tags="" position="2498,1469" size="100,100">You run as fast as you can towards the debris, whilst trying to make as little noise as possible. The thumping is mere metres away as you settle in amongst the rubble. You face the wall as this unknown entity moves alongside you. The sheer weight of its footsteps causes exposed dirt above to pour down onto your head, and you fight the urge to break your silence. 
A few seconds later, you can hear the creature meandering forward, its large strides quickly creating distance between you. Once you feel it is safe, you breathe a shaky sigh of relief and brush the dirt off yourself, moving cautiously in the direction that the creature came from. [[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;decide no.3]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="decide no.3" tags="" position="2629.3333333333335,1436.6666666666667" size="100,100">Only a few minutes pass before you reach what appears to be a massive, industrial sliding door, that is half open. As you pass though, there is a sign that reads “SECTION B”. not long thereafter you arrive at a split in the tunnel, with two clear paths to be taken. 
The path to the left is marked “TO GENERATOR”, the other “TO RESEARCH LAB”. 
On the one hand, the [[choose lab&lt;-research lab]] may provide you with some answers as to what has happened here, but the [[generator-&gt;choose generator]] might be capable of repair, in which case the facility might be a little less precarious to move through from here on out. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="choose lab" tags="" position="2626,1556.6666666666667" size="100,100">You head right towards the Lab, hoping that you can make your way in with ease, and find the answers you seek. 
You walk for a few minutes before the lab comes into view. You are almost at the lab entrance when you notice a small hole, laden with glowing slime, that has been dug out beside the tunnel. It sits directly opposite to the Lab doorway, and you can hear the murmur of something in there. 
You try to sneak forward and through the lab door. As you turn and glance into the hole, a creature glares at you silently, its teeth in full display, almost grinning maniacally.
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;choose lab2]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="choose generator" tags="" position="4243,818" size="100,100">You decide to head left towards the generator. Given the clearly decrepit state of the facility thus far, the lab entrance might not even be open. It seems unlikely, but hopefully there is a chance that you can somehow power up the facility. 
You find that the generator room is a short walk away. Luckily, it is open, due to the glass sliding doors somehow being shattered. The glass crackles as you carefully move through the door and into the [[room-&gt;arrive at generator room]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="arrive at generator room" tags="" position="4359,817" size="100,100">The generator room is in disarray.  It was evidently not spared the damage sustained by the rest of the facility. The mostly concrete interior is severely damaged and the likelihood of restoring power seems slim. 
You approach the generator and realise that the fuse box that once powered it is broken. After some inspection, it seems as though the issue is one of the four fuses has been ruined, as it sits off-kilter in its slot, bent slightly in the middle. 
You decide to search for a replacement. The only place you think it might be is at the other end of the room, where a steel [[supply cupboard]] sits with its doors ajar. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="supply cupboard" tags="" position="4475,814" size="100,100">You make your way over to the supply cupboard, where miscellaneous electrical items lie strewn about, many of which are unrecognizable. You soon find a box full of spare fuses, grab one and return to the generator. 
Carefully, you remove the damaged fuse and replace it with the new one. The fuse box begins to hum gently, and the only thing you can think to do is to pull the lever on the side of the generator. Immediately, it whirs back to life, and the lights above you beam down on you with a yellowy glow. You hear the lights out in the corridor groan as they return from disuse, and the sights and sounds provide an unlikely feeling of hopefulness. 
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;creatures approach]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="creatures approach" tags="" position="4589.333333333333,813" size="100,100">Mere seconds later, any hope you had dissolves within you, as the sound of thumping in the distance zooms through the tunnels and into your ears. It matches the sound of the creature from before, the difference being that there are many more footsteps. 
Suddenly you hear a series of strained, animalistic croaks that signal only one thing – anger. You search desperately for a place to [[hide-&gt;hide]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="hide" tags="" position="4715.666666666667,808" size="100,100">Beside the generator lies a giant pile of rubble, where a ventilation shaft sits idly above its apex. You clamber up the ruins and much of it slips out from underneath you on your way up. The thumping and croaking noises are getting louder by the second. The creatures aren’t meandering as the other was before it, they seem to be running about in fury. 
You pull at the vent for a few seconds before it bursts open and you climb in with a quickness that surprises you. With no desire to sit about and await the arrival of these things, instead crawling forward and deeper into the [[vent-&gt;vent to lab]].

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="vent to lab" tags="" position="4832,807" size="100,100">You can hear the thudding as you crawl further through the vents, as you realise that you are crawling parallel to the tunnels. As you slowly move onward, the thudding becomes less and less audible. Then they cannot be heard at all, and you presume they have all moved toward the sections of the tunnel from which you came. Eventually, you take the next turn out of the vent into the tunnel, kicking the vent open and landing in the farther side of section B.
It appears that the tunnel was constructed in a loop at this section, as you soon see the option to traverse backward towards the [[lab-&gt;lab arrive]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="lab arrive" tags="" position="4949,805" size="100,100">As the tunnel bends and the entrance to the lab comes into view, something stops you dead in your tracks. Now that the tunnels are illuminated, you can see even from a distance a pile of the glowing substance from before. It is pooling at the entrance to a hole, that appears to have been dug out from the side of the tunnel. You search for any sign of present danger but find only stillness.
You walk forward slowly, soon reaching the lab entrance and the adjacent hole. You realise that the slime has hardened, coating the entirety of the hole as far as you can see. You can only assume that this is the work of those creatures – perhaps a nest of some kind. Turning the generator on must have lured them out. 
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;lab enter]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="lab enter" tags="" position="5060,802" size="100,100">You turn toward the lab, as its doors smoothly slide open to greet you. You stop instantly, taking the time to process all that you see.
In the corner what remains of the scientists sit, their lab coats in shreds draped over them. Their bodies lie been ripped apart and left behind. You avert your eyes for fear of being ill.
In the centre of the room you see three large cylindrical glass structures, all of which are broken. Two sit completely broken and empty, but the one in the middle is only partially cracked, half full with some odd liquid and a small creature inside it. It floats on the surface, unmoving. It is a putrid yellow colour, thin and covered in scales. Its mouth is frozen in place with its teeth bare, presumably growling when it died. 
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;find note]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="find note" tags="" position="5189,802" size="100,100">You move around the room, unsure of what you are searching for. Whilst scanning your surroundings, A piece of paper on one of the desks catches your eye. It is just like the note you found earlier, the same handwriting all along the page. You pick up the [[note-&gt;examine note]] and examine it. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="examine note" tags="note" position="5304.333333333333,799" size="100,100">They never let me into the lab before. Now I see why.
The situation is far more dire than I had initially predicted. The scientists seem to have lost control of these things, whatever they are. I've been left in the dark about what exactly this facility was for, and frankly, it makes sense. No one in their right mind would have accepted this job knowing what I know now.
In coming here, I cannot help but fear that I may face a similar fate at the hands of these creatures. What I heard on my way here must have been them. I can only hope I don't bear the misfortune of encountering them, but the chance of that seems unavoidably high.
I have decided to risk making my way to sector A, in the hopes that waste processing will provide me with suitable shelter until someone comes to help. It is properly reinforced, and there is only one way in or out.  
This whole plan is riding on the hopes that someone arrives to rescue me, but I can’t afford to risk going to the entrance alone.  Who knows how many of these things there are. 
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;leave lab]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="leave lab" tags="" position="5426,797" size="100,100">Whoever this man was, you cannot help but hope he made it out. You can’t help but think that if he didn’t, then it is likely that you won’t either. All you know for certain is you must move. The creatures are gone now but something tells you they’ll be back here soon. You recompose yourself and move toward the door and out into the [[tunnel-&gt;toward waste]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="toward waste" tags="" position="5550,798" size="100,100">Thankfully, the tunnel is as silent as it was when you entered the lab. You move quickly toward what can only be sector A, hoping the worst is behind you. 
It is a short walk before you arrive at another industrial door, where the words “SECTOR A” are inscribed on the wall. Beneath it you can see “SECTOR A SECURITY”, as well as “WASTE PROCESSING” – both of which are indicated to be ahead.
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;sector a]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="sector a" tags="" position="5664,797" size="100,100">You consider avoiding waste processing entirely, but something in you must know what happened to the man. Maybe he left a note that can help you to get out, or even provide more information as to what really happened here.
You realise that it is almost laughable, given how dangerous the situation is, but it is more than mere curiosity - within you lies an inexplicable urge to find out.  
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;alarm choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="alarm choice" tags="" position="6637,548" size="100,100">You proceed forward, weary of the possibility that you are not alone. You reach the waste processing facility, which has a sign beside it which reads: “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY”. Beside it you see what appears to be an alarm, and a button to open the door. The alarm is a small steel contraption, with a red light directly above it. It is difficult to tell if the alarm is functional; it appears to be dimly lit, but it may be the case that it is still inactive. 
You could try and [[press the button]] – there is always the chance that the alarm is broken and unusable, much like the rest of the facility. However, it may be worth [[checking the security office]] to check that the alarm isn’t on and deactivate it if necessary. 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="press the button" tags="" position="6644,671" size="100,100">You decide to press the button. A few seconds pass, and nothing happens. 
Then, just as you thought it was safe, the old alarm puffs out dust and lets out a deafening ring. It is loud, but not loud enough to drown out the sound of the creatures approaching. 
You start running further into sector A but it is too late. The creatures are too quick, and it seems there are no options left for you. Before you know it you are yanked backward, and devoured in a matter of seconds.

The security office is close, and you reach it quickly. Inside, you see that the alarms must have been activated when you restored power to the generator.

You turn and observe the large steel structure, with numerous conveyor belts leading in and out of it. It appears the creatures have not yet made this place their own. At the opposite end of the room you can see some sort of [[small office]], which strikes you as the best place to look.

Without any notice, your lighter slips from your hand and makes a small thud on the now-hardened slime beneath. The creature turns quickly and pursues the sound, and before you know it you are attacked.

You crouch along for some time, and gradually the tunnel opens, allowing you to eventually move upright. The only problem is the tunnel is still going down. 
Continuing down the tunnel, it is not long before it opens up into a larger area. You move along the perimeter, but the only visible path is tiny – only just large enough to crawl through. There is no other option but to [[crawl forward-&gt;crawl forward (9)]].

You kick for a couple of minutes, but just as you are about to turn back the crawlspace caves in on itself and you are almost swallowed up by the wave of soil. 
The only way is forward. You kick with greater urgency and just as your efforts begin to feel futile, the metal gives way, and you are faced with some sort of air vent. 
You shuffle towards it and move into the [[vent-&gt;vent(9)]].

It dawns on you that it is quite miraculous that you have made it this far without injury. 
There is a substantial drop from the vent onto the ground of the tunnel, which almost buckles your legs and leaves your feet numb for a moment. You land and survey your surroundings further. There is minimal light – a small bulb that illuminates the tunnel every twenty metres or so, but the rest is obscured in almost complete darkness. A short distance to your left, there is a large sign that says “SECTOR C SECURITY” with an arrow pointing deeper into the tunnel. To your right, the tunnel seems to end abruptly.

I was in the sublevel examining some odd noises that had been reported for some time. As it turns out, some sort of animal burrowed down and was running rampant down there. In the few hours I spent investigating the issue, it seems something very sinister has occurred.
Up here on the main level, all the security and communications systems have been disabled. There is no sign of anyone here - the reason for this I have not yet ascertained. 
I feel obliged to make my way over to the central lab to find some answers, but there is a heavy thumping and scraping coming from the hallway outside the Security office.  
It is not a sound I’ve heard before in my time here, so naturally I assume the worst. My supplies here are also limited – I have less than a day’s worth of food here, that I found in the guard’s office. I hope whatever is making these noises stops soon.

It is a person, propped up against the wall with their head tilted down toward their chest. One would assume he was asleep, if not for the darkened, dried blood that stains the floor around him.

More concerning still, is the pile of glowing liquid that lies to his right, previously obscured from view. It is the same as the kind you observed in the tunnel earlier.

Whatever is here drifts past you, and there is a split second of relief as it seems you’ve gon unnoticed. Abruptly thereafter, this unknown being finds itself caught on your backpack, and it leaps at you.

Given the clearly decrepit state of the facility thus far, the lab entrance might not even be open. It seems unlikely, but hopefully there is a chance that you can somehow power up the facility. 
You find that the generator room is a short walk away. Luckily, it is open, due to the glass sliding doors somehow being shattered. The glass crackles as you carefully move through the door and into the [[room-&gt;arrive at generator room 3]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="arrive at generator room 3" tags="" position="4338,1131" size="100,100">The generator room is in disarray.  It was evidently not spared the damage sustained by the rest of the facility. The mostly concrete interior is severely damaged and the likelihood of restoring power seems slim. 
You approach the generator and realise that the fuse box that once powered it is broken. After some inspection, it seems as though the issue is one of the four fuses has been ruined, as it sits off-kilter in its slot, bent slightly in the middle. 
You decide to search for a replacement. The only place you think it might be is at the other end of the room, where a steel [[supply cupboard-&gt;supply cupboard3]] sits with its doors ajar. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="105" name="supply cupboard3" tags="" position="4456,1133" size="100,100">You make your way over to the supply cupboard, where miscellaneous electrical items lie strewn about, many of which are unrecognizable.

Carefully, you remove the damaged fuse and replace it with the new one. The fuse box begins to hum gently, and the only thing you can think to do is to pull the lever on the side of the generator. Immediately, it whirs back to life, and the lights above you beam down on you with a yellowy glow. You hear the lights out in the corridor groan as they return from disuse, and the sights and sounds provide an unlikely feeling of hopefulness.

Suddenly you hear a series of strained, animalistic croaks that signal only one thing – anger. You search desperately for a place to [[hide-&gt;hide3]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="107" name="hide3" tags="" position="4690,1140" size="100,100">Beside the generator lies a giant pile of rubble, where a ventilation shaft sits idly above its apex. You clamber up the ruins and much of it slips out from underneath you on your way up. The thumping and croaking noises are getting louder by the second. The creatures aren’t meandering as the other was before it, they seem to be running about in fury. 
You pull at the vent for a few seconds before it bursts open and you climb in with a quickness that surprises you. With no desire to sit about and await the arrival of these things, instead crawling forward and deeper into the [[vent-&gt;vent to lab3]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="108" name="vent to lab3" tags="" position="4808,1136.3333333333333" size="100,100">You can hear the thudding as you crawl further through the vents, as you realise that you are crawling parallel to the tunnels. As you slowly move onward, the thudding becomes less and less audible. Then they cannot be heard at all, and you presume they have all moved toward the sections of the tunnel from which you came. Eventually, you take the next turn out of the vent into the tunnel, kicking the vent open and landing in the farther side of section B.
It appears that the tunnel was constructed in a loop at this section, as you soon see the option to traverse backward towards the [[lab-&gt;lab arrive3]].

Now that the tunnels are illuminated, you can see even from a distance a pile of the glowing substance from before. It is pooling at the entrance to a hole, that appears to have been dug out from the side of the tunnel. You search for any sign of present danger but find only stillness.
You walk forward slowly, soon reaching the lab entrance and the adjacent hole. You realise that the slime has hardened, coating the entirety of the hole as far as you can see. You can only assume that this is the work of those creatures – perhaps a nest of some kind. Turning the generator on must have lured them out.

In the corner what remains of the scientists sit, their lab coats in shreds draped over them. Their bodies lie been ripped apart and left behind. You avert your eyes for fear of being ill.
In the centre of the room you see three large cylindrical glass structures, all of which are broken. Two sit completely broken and empty, but the one in the middle is only partially cracked, half full with some odd liquid and a small creature inside it. It floats on the surface, unmoving. It is a putrid yellow colour, thin and covered in scales. Its mouth is frozen in place with its teeth bare, presumably growling when it died.

Now I see why.
The situation is far more dire than I had initially predicted. The scientists seem to have lost control of these things, whatever they are. I've been left in the dark about what exactly this facility was for, and frankly, it makes sense. No one in their right mind would have accepted this job knowing what I know now.
In coming here, I cannot help but fear that I may face a similar fate at the hands of these creatures. What I heard on my way here must have been them. I can only hope I don't bear the misfortune of encountering them, but the chance of that seems unavoidably high.
I have decided to risk making my way to sector A, in the hopes that waste processing will provide me with suitable shelter until someone comes to help. It is properly reinforced, and there is only one way in or out.  
This whole plan is riding on the hopes that someone arrives to rescue me, but I can’t afford to risk going to the entrance alone.  Who knows how many of these things there are.

You move quickly toward what can only be sector A, hoping the worst is behind you. 
It is a short walk before you arrive at another industrial door, where the words “SECTOR A” are inscribed on the wall. Beneath it you can see “SECTOR A SECURITY”, as well as “WASTE PROCESSING” – both of which are indicated to be ahead.

You realise that it is almost laughable, given how dangerous the situation is, but it is more than mere curiosity - within you lies an inexplicable urge to find out.

You reach the waste processing facility, which has a sign beside it which reads: “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY”. Beside it you see what appears to be an alarm, and a button to open the door. The alarm is a small steel contraption, with a red light directly above it. It is difficult to tell if the alarm is functional; it appears to be dimly lit, but it may be the case that it is still inactive. 
You could try and [[press the button-&gt;press the button4]] – there is always the chance that the alarm is broken and unusable, much like the rest of the facility. However, it may be worth [[checking the security office-&gt;checking the security office3]] to check that the alarm isn’t on and deactivate it if necessary.

Then, just as you thought it was safe, the old alarm puffs out dust and lets out a deafening ring. It is loud, but not loud enough to drown out the sound of the creatures approaching. 
You start running further into sector A but it is too late. The creatures are too quick, and it seems there are no options left for you. Before you know it you are yanked backward, and devoured in a matter of seconds.

Depleted and near defeat, you turn and stumble upward, towards the light and out into the open air of the forest. You stumble on, beneath the trees, in search of refuge.

It has been some time now, perhaps days, and the creatures remain at the door, banging and moaning at me to let them in. The sound is deafening.
At this point any hope I had left someone coming to help me has been whittled away to near nothing. If someone was to come they would have been here by now.
In what can only be my last fleeting days left, I cannot help but think of who I left behind for all this.

You begin to run, but fear sets in as the thumping grows louder with each second. The large elevator that must be the exit is in sight, about a hundred metres ahead. You look behind and see a massive group of them closing in on you, croaking gleefully in unison after having finally found you.

You erode into the void, with no hope of knowing what could have been.

It was evidently not spared the damage sustained by the rest of the facility. The mostly concrete interior is severely damaged and the likelihood of restoring power seems slim. 
You approach the generator and realise that the fuse box that once powered it is broken. After some inspection, it seems as though the issue is one of the four fuses has been ruined, as it sits off-kilter in its slot, bent slightly in the middle. 
You decide to search for a replacement. The only place you think it might be is at the other end of the room, where a steel [[supply cupboard-&gt;supply cupboard5]] sits with its doors ajar. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="supply cupboard5" tags="" position="4456,1455.3333333333333" size="100,100">You make your way over to the supply cupboard, where miscellaneous electrical items lie strewn about, many of which are unrecognizable. You soon find a box full of spare fuses, grab one and return to the generator. 
Carefully, you remove the damaged fuse and replace it with the new one. The fuse box begins to hum gently, and the only thing you can think to do is to pull the lever on the side of the generator. Immediately, it whirs back to life, and the lights above you beam down on you with a yellowy glow. You hear the lights out in the corridor groan as they return from disuse, and the sights and sounds provide an unlikely feeling of hopefulness.

It matches the sound of the creature from before, the difference being that there are many more footsteps. 
Suddenly you hear a series of strained, animalistic croaks that signal only one thing – anger. You search desperately for a place to [[hide-&gt;hide5]].

You clamber up the ruins and much of it slips out from underneath you on your way up. The thumping and croaking noises are getting louder by the second. The creatures aren’t meandering as the other was before it, they seem to be running about in fury. 
You pull at the vent for a few seconds before it bursts open and you climb in with a quickness that surprises you. With no desire to sit about and await the arrival of these things, instead crawling forward and deeper into the [[vent-&gt;vent to lab5]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="vent to lab5" tags="" position="4809.333333333334,1462" size="100,100">You can hear the thudding as you crawl further through the vents, as you realise that you are crawling parallel to the tunnels. As you slowly move onward, the thudding becomes less and less audible. Then they cannot be heard at all, and you presume they have all moved toward the sections of the tunnel from which you came. Eventually, you take the next turn out of the vent into the tunnel, kicking the vent open and landing in the farther side of section B.
It appears that the tunnel was constructed in a loop at this section, as you soon see the option to traverse backward towards the [[lab-&gt;lab arrive5]].

Now that the tunnels are illuminated, you can see even from a distance a pile of the glowing substance from before. It is pooling at the entrance to a hole, that appears to have been dug out from the side of the tunnel. You search for any sign of present danger but find only stillness.
You walk forward slowly, soon reaching the lab entrance and the adjacent hole. You realise that the slime has hardened, coating the entirety of the hole as far as you can see. You can only assume that this is the work of those creatures – perhaps a nest of some kind. Turning the generator on must have lured them out.

In the corner what remains of the scientists sit, their lab coats in shreds draped over them. Their bodies lie been ripped apart and left behind. You avert your eyes for fear of being ill.
In the centre of the room you see three large cylindrical glass structures, all of which are broken. Two sit completely broken and empty, but the one in the middle is only partially cracked, half full with some odd liquid and a small creature inside it. It floats on the surface, unmoving. It is a putrid yellow colour, thin and covered in scales. Its mouth is frozen in place with its teeth bare, presumably growling when it died.

Whilst scanning your surroundings, A piece of paper on one of the desks catches your eye. It is just like the note you found earlier, the same handwriting all along the page.

Now I see why.
The situation is far more dire than I had initially predicted. The scientists seem to have lost control of these things, whatever they are. I've been left in the dark about what exactly this facility was for, and frankly, it makes sense. No one in their right mind would have accepted this job knowing what I know now.
In coming here, I cannot help but fear that I may face a similar fate at the hands of these creatures. What I heard on my way here must have been them. I can only hope I don't bear the misfortune of encountering them, but the chance of that seems unavoidably high.
I have decided to risk making my way to sector A, in the hopes that waste processing will provide me with suitable shelter until someone comes to help. It is properly reinforced, and there is only one way in or out.  
This whole plan is riding on the hopes that someone arrives to rescue me, but I can’t afford to risk going to the entrance alone.  Who knows how many of these things there are.

You can’t help but think that if he didn’t, then it is likely that you won’t either. All you know for certain is you must move. The creatures are gone now but something tells you they’ll be back here soon.

You move quickly toward what can only be sector A, hoping the worst is behind you. 
It is a short walk before you arrive at another industrial door, where the words “SECTOR A” are inscribed on the wall. Beneath it you can see “SECTOR A SECURITY”, as well as “WASTE PROCESSING” – both of which are indicated to be ahead.

The alarm is a small steel contraption, with a red light directly above it. It is difficult to tell if the alarm is functional; it appears to be dimly lit, but it may be the case that it is still inactive. 
You could try and [[press the button-&gt;press the button6]] – there is always the chance that the alarm is broken and unusable, much like the rest of the facility.

Eventually, the lift stops. Its doors creak open to reveal a small cave, the light of day greeting you from afar, a slight incline from where you stand. 
You step out and the lift shuts, and rock walls shift into place to conceal the elevator. If one had not seen them close, it would appear to be just a small cave, nothing more. 
Depleted and near defeat, you turn and stumble upward, towards the light and out into the open air of the forest. You stumble on, beneath the trees, in search of refuge.

You turn and continue forward for a few seconds before the loud thumping of the creatures begins somewhere deep in the tunnels behind you. 
You begin to run, but fear sets in as the thumping grows louder with each second. The large elevator that must be the exit is in sight, about a hundred metres ahead. You look behind and see a massive group of them closing in on you, croaking gleefully in unison after having finally found you.

Given the clearly decrepit state of the facility thus far, the lab entrance might not even be open. It seems unlikely, but hopefully there is a chance that you can somehow power up the facility. 
You find that the generator room is a short walk away. Luckily, it is open, due to the glass sliding doors somehow being shattered. The glass crackles as you carefully move through the door and into the [[room-&gt;arrive at generator room 7]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="arrive at generator room 7" tags="" position="4319.333333333333,1871.666666666667" size="100,100">The generator room is in disarray.  It was evidently not spared the damage sustained by the rest of the facility. The mostly concrete interior is severely damaged and the likelihood of restoring power seems slim. 
You approach the generator and realise that the fuse box that once powered it is broken. After some inspection, it seems as though the issue is one of the four fuses has been ruined, as it sits off-kilter in its slot, bent slightly in the middle. 
You decide to search for a replacement. The only place you think it might be is at the other end of the room, where a steel [[supply cupboard-&gt;supply cupboard7]] sits with its doors ajar. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="190" name="supply cupboard7" tags="" position="4436,1880.0000000000002" size="100,100">You make your way over to the supply cupboard, where miscellaneous electrical items lie strewn about, many of which are unrecognizable. You soon find a box full of spare fuses, grab one and return to the generator. 
Carefully, you remove the damaged fuse and replace it with the new one. The fuse box begins to hum gently, and the only thing you can think to do is to pull the lever on the side of the generator. Immediately, it whirs back to life, and the lights above you beam down on you with a yellowy glow. You hear the lights out in the corridor groan as they return from disuse, and the sights and sounds provide an unlikely feeling of hopefulness.

It matches the sound of the creature from before, the difference being that there are many more footsteps. 
Suddenly you hear a series of strained, animalistic croaks that signal only one thing – anger. You search desperately for a place to [[hide-&gt;hide7]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="192" name="hide7" tags="" position="4681,1886.666666666667" size="100,100">Beside the generator lies a giant pile of rubble, where a ventilation shaft sits idly above its apex. You clamber up the ruins and much of it slips out from underneath you on your way up. The thumping and croaking noises are getting louder by the second. The creatures aren’t meandering as the other was before it, they seem to be running about in fury. 
You pull at the vent for a few seconds before it bursts open and you climb in with a quickness that surprises you. With no desire to sit about and await the arrival of these things, instead crawling forward and deeper into the [[vent-&gt;vent to lab7]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="193" name="vent to lab7" tags="" position="4802.666666666667,1876.666666666667" size="100,100">You can hear the thudding as you crawl further through the vents, as you realise that you are crawling parallel to the tunnels. As you slowly move onward, the thudding becomes less and less audible. Then they cannot be heard at all, and you presume they have all moved toward the sections of the tunnel from which you came. Eventually, you take the next turn out of the vent into the tunnel, kicking the vent open and landing in the farther side of section B.
It appears that the tunnel was constructed in a loop at this section, as you soon see the option to traverse backward towards the [[lab-&gt;lab arrive7]].

Now that the tunnels are illuminated, you can see even from a distance a pile of the glowing substance from before. It is pooling at the entrance to a hole, that appears to have been dug out from the side of the tunnel. You search for any sign of present danger but find only stillness.
You walk forward slowly, soon reaching the lab entrance and the adjacent hole. You realise that the slime has hardened, coating the entirety of the hole as far as you can see. You can only assume that this is the work of those creatures – perhaps a nest of some kind. Turning the generator on must have lured them out.

In the corner what remains of the scientists sit, their lab coats in shreds draped over them. Their bodies lie been ripped apart and left behind. You avert your eyes for fear of being ill.
In the centre of the room you see three large cylindrical glass structures, all of which are broken. Two sit completely broken and empty, but the one in the middle is only partially cracked, half full with some odd liquid and a small creature inside it. It floats on the surface, unmoving. It is a putrid yellow colour, thin and covered in scales. Its mouth is frozen in place with its teeth bare, presumably growling when it died.

Now I see why.
The situation is far more dire than I had initially predicted. The scientists seem to have lost control of these things, whatever they are. I've been left in the dark about what exactly this facility was for, and frankly, it makes sense. No one in their right mind would have accepted this job knowing what I know now.
In coming here, I cannot help but fear that I may face a similar fate at the hands of these creatures. What I heard on my way here must have been them. I can only hope I don't bear the misfortune of encountering them, but the chance of that seems unavoidably high.
I have decided to risk making my way to sector A, in the hopes that waste processing will provide me with suitable shelter until someone comes to help. It is properly reinforced, and there is only one way in or out.  
This whole plan is riding on the hopes that someone arrives to rescue me, but I can’t afford to risk going to the entrance alone.  Who knows how many of these things there are.

You can’t help but think that if he didn’t, then it is likely that you won’t either. All you know for certain is you must move. The creatures are gone now but something tells you they’ll be back here soon. You recompose yourself and move toward the door and out into the [[tunnel-&gt;toward waste7]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="199" name="toward waste7" tags="" position="5522.666666666668,1885.0000000000002" size="100,100">Thankfully, the tunnel is as silent as it was when you entered the lab. You move quickly toward what can only be sector A, hoping the worst is behind you. 
It is a short walk before you arrive at another industrial door, where the words “SECTOR A” are inscribed on the wall. Beneath it you can see “SECTOR A SECURITY”, as well as “WASTE PROCESSING” – both of which are indicated to be ahead.

Maybe he left a note that can help you to get out, or even provide more information as to what really happened here.

You reach the waste processing facility, which has a sign beside it which reads: “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY”. Beside it you see what appears to be an alarm, and a button to open the door. The alarm is a small steel contraption, with a red light directly above it. It is difficult to tell if the alarm is functional; it appears to be dimly lit, but it may be the case that it is still inactive. 
You could try and [[press the button-&gt;press the button8]] – there is always the chance that the alarm is broken and unusable, much like the rest of the facility. However, it may be worth [[checking the security office-&gt;checking the security office7]] to check that the alarm isn’t on and deactivate it if necessary.

The security office is close, and you reach it quickly. Inside, you see that the alarms must have been activated when you restored power to the generator.

Then, just as you thought it was safe, the old alarm puffs out dust and lets out a deafening ring. It is loud, but not loud enough to drown out the sound of the creatures approaching. 
You start running further into sector A but it is too late. The creatures are too quick, and it seems there are no options left for you. Before you know it you are yanked backward, and devoured in a matter of seconds.

It was evidently not spared the damage sustained by the rest of the facility. The mostly concrete interior is severely damaged and the likelihood of restoring power seems slim. 
You approach the generator and realise that the fuse box that once powered it is broken. After some inspection, it seems as though the issue is one of the four fuses has been ruined, as it sits off-kilter in its slot, bent slightly in the middle. 
You decide to search for a replacement. The only place you think it might be is at the other end of the room, where a steel [[supply cupboard-&gt;supply cupboard9]] sits with its doors ajar.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="231" name="supply cupboard9" tags="" position="4431.666666666666,2289.6666666666665" size="100,100">You make your way over to the supply cupboard, where miscellaneous electrical items lie strewn about, many of which are unrecognizable. You soon find a box full of spare fuses, grab one and return to the generator. 
Carefully, you remove the damaged fuse and replace it with the new one. The fuse box begins to hum gently, and the only thing you can think to do is to pull the lever on the side of the generator. Immediately, it whirs back to life, and the lights above you beam down on you with a yellowy glow. You hear the lights out in the corridor groan as they return from disuse, and the sights and sounds provide an unlikely feeling of hopefulness.

It matches the sound of the creature from before, the difference being that there are many more footsteps. 
Suddenly you hear a series of strained, animalistic croaks that signal only one thing – anger. You search desperately for a place to [[hide-&gt;hide9]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="233" name="hide9" tags="" position="4674.999999999999,2291.3333333333335" size="100,100">Beside the generator lies a giant pile of rubble, where a ventilation shaft sits idly above its apex. You clamber up the ruins and much of it slips out from underneath you on your way up. The thumping and croaking noises are getting louder by the second. The creatures aren’t meandering as the other was before it, they seem to be running about in fury. 
You pull at the vent for a few seconds before it bursts open and you climb in with a quickness that surprises you. With no desire to sit about and await the arrival of these things, instead crawling forward and deeper into the [[vent-&gt;vent to lab9]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="234" name="vent to lab9" tags="" position="4803.333333333332,2296.3333333333335" size="100,100">You can hear the thudding as you crawl further through the vents, as you realise that you are crawling parallel to the tunnels. As you slowly move onward, the thudding becomes less and less audible. Then they cannot be heard at all, and you presume they have all moved toward the sections of the tunnel from which you came. Eventually, you take the next turn out of the vent into the tunnel, kicking the vent open and landing in the farther side of section B.
It appears that the tunnel was constructed in a loop at this section, as you soon see the option to traverse backward towards the [[lab-&gt;lab arrive9]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="235" name="lab arrive9" tags="" position="4918.333333333332,2296.3333333333335" size="100,100">As the tunnel bends and the entrance to the lab comes into view, something stops you dead in your tracks. Now that the tunnels are illuminated, you can see even from a distance a pile of the glowing substance from before. It is pooling at the entrance to a hole, that appears to have been dug out from the side of the tunnel. You search for any sign of present danger but find only stillness.
You walk forward slowly, soon reaching the lab entrance and the adjacent hole. You realise that the slime has hardened, coating the entirety of the hole as far as you can see. You can only assume that this is the work of those creatures – perhaps a nest of some kind. Turning the generator on must have lured them out.

In the corner what remains of the scientists sit, their lab coats in shreds draped over them. Their bodies lie been ripped apart and left behind. You avert your eyes for fear of being ill.
In the centre of the room you see three large cylindrical glass structures, all of which are broken. Two sit completely broken and empty, but the one in the middle is only partially cracked, half full with some odd liquid and a small creature inside it. It floats on the surface, unmoving. It is a putrid yellow colour, thin and covered in scales. Its mouth is frozen in place with its teeth bare, presumably growling when it died.

Whilst scanning your surroundings, A piece of paper on one of the desks catches your eye. It is just like the note you found earlier, the same handwriting all along the page.

Now I see why.
The situation is far more dire than I had initially predicted. The scientists seem to have lost control of these things, whatever they are. I've been left in the dark about what exactly this facility was for, and frankly, it makes sense. No one in their right mind would have accepted this job knowing what I know now.
In coming here, I cannot help but fear that I may face a similar fate at the hands of these creatures. What I heard on my way here must have been them. I can only hope I don't bear the misfortune of encountering them, but the chance of that seems unavoidably high.
I have decided to risk making my way to sector A, in the hopes that waste processing will provide me with suitable shelter until someone comes to help. It is properly reinforced, and there is only one way in or out.  
This whole plan is riding on the hopes that someone arrives to rescue me, but I can’t afford to risk going to the entrance alone.  Who knows how many of these things there are.

You can’t help but think that if he didn’t, then it is likely that you won’t either. All you know for certain is you must move. The creatures are gone now but something tells you they’ll be back here soon.

You move quickly toward what can only be sector A, hoping the worst is behind you. 
It is a short walk before you arrive at another industrial door, where the words “SECTOR A” are inscribed on the wall. Beneath it you can see “SECTOR A SECURITY”, as well as “WASTE PROCESSING” – both of which are indicated to be ahead.

Maybe he left a note that can help you to get out, or even provide more information as to what really happened here.
You realise that it is almost laughable, given how dangerous the situation is, but it is more than mere curiosity - within you lies an inexplicable urge to find out.

You reach the waste processing facility, which has a sign beside it which reads: “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY”. Beside it you see what appears to be an alarm, and a button to open the door. The alarm is a small steel contraption, with a red light directly above it. It is difficult to tell if the alarm is functional; it appears to be dimly lit, but it may be the case that it is still inactive. 
You could try and [[press the button-&gt;press the button10]] – there is always the chance that the alarm is broken and unusable, much like the rest of the facility. However, it may be worth [[checking the security office-&gt;checking the security office9]] to check that the alarm isn’t on and deactivate it if necessary.

Then, just as you thought it was safe, the old alarm puffs out dust and lets out a deafening ring. It is loud, but not loud enough to drown out the sound of the creatures approaching. 
You start running further into sector A but it is too late. The creatures are too quick, and it seems there are no options left for you. Before you know it you are yanked backward, and devoured in a matter of seconds.

The security office is close, and you reach it quickly. Inside, you see that the alarms must have been activated when you restored power to the generator. With the simple flick of a switch, the alarm is off. You think of what could have just happened and breathe a shaky sigh of relief.

You begin to run, but fear sets in as the thumping grows louder with each second. The large elevator that must be the exit is in sight, about a hundred metres ahead. You look behind and see a massive group of them closing in on you, croaking gleefully in unison after having finally found you.

Given the clearly decrepit state of the facility thus far, the lab entrance might not even be open. It seems unlikely, but hopefully there is a chance that you can somehow power up the facility. 
You find that the generator room is a short walk away. Luckily, it is open, due to the glass sliding doors somehow being shattered. The glass crackles as you carefully move through the door and into the [[room-&gt;arrive at generator room 11]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="271" name="arrive at generator room 11" tags="" position="4302.666666666667,2693" size="100,100">The generator room is in disarray.  It was evidently not spared the damage sustained by the rest of the facility. The mostly concrete interior is severely damaged and the likelihood of restoring power seems slim. 
You approach the generator and realise that the fuse box that once powered it is broken. After some inspection, it seems as though the issue is one of the four fuses has been ruined, as it sits off-kilter in its slot, bent slightly in the middle. 
You decide to search for a replacement. The only place you think it might be is at the other end of the room, where a steel [[supply cupboard-&gt;supply cupboard11]] sits with its doors ajar.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="272" name="supply cupboard11" tags="" position="4431,2693" size="100,100">You make your way over to the supply cupboard, where miscellaneous electrical items lie strewn about, many of which are unrecognizable. You soon find a box full of spare fuses, grab one and return to the generator. 
Carefully, you remove the damaged fuse and replace it with the new one. The fuse box begins to hum gently, and the only thing you can think to do is to pull the lever on the side of the generator. Immediately, it whirs back to life, and the lights above you beam down on you with a yellowy glow. You hear the lights out in the corridor groan as they return from disuse, and the sights and sounds provide an unlikely feeling of hopefulness.

It matches the sound of the creature from before, the difference being that there are many more footsteps. 
Suddenly you hear a series of strained, animalistic croaks that signal only one thing – anger. You search desperately for a place to [[hide-&gt;hide11]].
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="274" name="hide11" tags="" position="4681,2686.3333333333335" size="100,100">Beside the generator lies a giant pile of rubble, where a ventilation shaft sits idly above its apex. You clamber up the ruins and much of it slips out from underneath you on your way up. The thumping and croaking noises are getting louder by the second. The creatures aren’t meandering as the other was before it, they seem to be running about in fury. 
You pull at the vent for a few seconds before it bursts open and you climb in with a quickness that surprises you. With no desire to sit about and await the arrival of these things, instead crawling forward and deeper into the [[vent-&gt;vent to lab11]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="275" name="vent to lab11" tags="" position="4811.000000000001,2679.666666666667" size="100,100">You can hear the thudding as you crawl further through the vents, as you realise that you are crawling parallel to the tunnels. As you slowly move onward, the thudding becomes less and less audible. Then they cannot be heard at all, and you presume they have all moved toward the sections of the tunnel from which you came. Eventually, you take the next turn out of the vent into the tunnel, kicking the vent open and landing in the farther side of section B.
It appears that the tunnel was constructed in a loop at this section, as you soon see the option to traverse backward towards the [[lab-&gt;lab arrive11]].

Now that the tunnels are illuminated, you can see even from a distance a pile of the glowing substance from before. It is pooling at the entrance to a hole, that appears to have been dug out from the side of the tunnel. You search for any sign of present danger but find only stillness.
You walk forward slowly, soon reaching the lab entrance and the adjacent hole. You realise that the slime has hardened, coating the entirety of the hole as far as you can see. You can only assume that this is the work of those creatures – perhaps a nest of some kind. Turning the generator on must have lured them out.

You stop instantly, taking the time to process all that you see.
In the corner what remains of the scientists sit, their lab coats in shreds draped over them. Their bodies lie been ripped apart and left behind. You avert your eyes for fear of being ill.
In the centre of the room you see three large cylindrical glass structures, all of which are broken. Two sit completely broken and empty, but the one in the middle is only partially cracked, half full with some odd liquid and a small creature inside it. It floats on the surface, unmoving. It is a putrid yellow colour, thin and covered in scales. Its mouth is frozen in place with its teeth bare, presumably growling when it died.

Whilst scanning your surroundings, A piece of paper on one of the desks catches your eye. It is just like the note you found earlier, the same handwriting all along the page.

Now I see why.
The situation is far more dire than I had initially predicted. The scientists seem to have lost control of these things, whatever they are. I've been left in the dark about what exactly this facility was for, and frankly, it makes sense. No one in their right mind would have accepted this job knowing what I know now.
In coming here, I cannot help but fear that I may face a similar fate at the hands of these creatures. What I heard on my way here must have been them. I can only hope I don't bear the misfortune of encountering them, but the chance of that seems unavoidably high.
I have decided to risk making my way to sector A, in the hopes that waste processing will provide me with suitable shelter until someone comes to help. It is properly reinforced, and there is only one way in or out.  
This whole plan is riding on the hopes that someone arrives to rescue me, but I can’t afford to risk going to the entrance alone.  Who knows how many of these things there are.

You can’t help but think that if he didn’t, then it is likely that you won’t either. All you know for certain is you must move.

You move quickly toward what can only be sector A, hoping the worst is behind you. 
It is a short walk before you arrive at another industrial door, where the words “SECTOR A” are inscribed on the wall. Beneath it you can see “SECTOR A SECURITY”, as well as “WASTE PROCESSING” – both of which are indicated to be ahead.

Maybe he left a note that can help you to get out, or even provide more information as to what really happened here.

You reach the waste processing facility, which has a sign beside it which reads: “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY”. Beside it you see what appears to be an alarm, and a button to open the door. The alarm is a small steel contraption, with a red light directly above it. It is difficult to tell if the alarm is functional; it appears to be dimly lit, but it may be the case that it is still inactive. 
You could try and [[press the button-&gt;press the button12]] – there is always the chance that the alarm is broken and unusable, much like the rest of the facility. However, it may be worth [[checking the security office-&gt;checking the security office11]] to check that the alarm isn’t on and deactivate it if necessary.

Then, just as you thought it was safe, the old alarm puffs out dust and lets out a deafening ring. It is loud, but not loud enough to drown out the sound of the creatures approaching. 
You start running further into sector A but it is too late. The creatures are too quick, and it seems there are no options left for you. Before you know it you are yanked backward, and devoured in a matter of seconds.

They lie are in a ball on the floor, everything but their legs obscured by a large jacket. You feel a sickening pain in your chest as you pull the jacket back, and the eyes of your dead father stare blankly at the roof.

Your father sits with a beer and laughs heartily at you. You’ve gotten cake all over your face. He wipes it off and kisses your head, takes a puff off his cigarette and looks contentedly off into the distance.

You have spent hours upon hours at the desk, so filled with anguish that you exhaust yourself into a deep sleep. You know you must go. 
You return to your father, knowing you cannot leave with him. Inside his jacket you find his wallet, and a zippo lighter with his name engraved on it. You take it all.

Your head and stomach are wailing with pain, each for their own reason. You press the button to open the door and it whirs to life again, then you step out.
Outside the tunnel remains silent. You turn towards the end of sector A, where you see a marker on the wall that says “SECTOR A EXIT”.  
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;bad end1(16)]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="341" name="bad end1(16)" tags="" position="8007,2834.000000000001" size="100,100">You begin walking towards the exit. Suddenly, you hear part of the roof collapse behind you in the distance, rock crashing down from above with a thundering crack. You turn and continue forward for a few seconds before the loud thumping of the creatures begins somewhere deep in the tunnels behind you. 
You begin to run, but fear sets in as the thumping grows louder with each second. The large elevator that must be the exit is in sight, about a hundred metres ahead. You look behind and see a massive group of them closing in on you, croaking gleefully in unison after having finally found you. 
[[&gt;&gt;&gt;-&gt;bad end 2(16)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="342" name="bad end 2(16)" tags="" position="8152,2832.3333333333344" size="100,100">The elevator is too far, and the creatures grow nearer with every second. You run with all the energy you have remaining, but it isn’t enough. Mere metres from the exit your feet are yanked out from underneath you, and you are flattened by a pile of scaly bodies. You erode into the void, with no hope of knowing what could have been. 
[[All that remains is an empty blackness that has become your eternal home.-&gt;0/4]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="343" name="0/4" tags="" position="9092,2707.3333333333344" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
